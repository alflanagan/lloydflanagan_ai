# Claude AI Prompts

- Create a starter website in ~/Devel/personal/web/ai/lloydflanagan which uses
  python for the back end and lit with shoelace for the front end. It should
  have a home page with "A Lloyd Flanagan" as a header, and a menu with links
  "About Me", "Blog", "Education", each of which links to an empty page.
- Add a file to the project called PROMPTS.md. Write a markdown list with the
  heading "Claude AI Prompts" and each prompt for this session.
- Modify the PROMPTS.md file to wrap text at column 80, and append this prompt
  to the list.
- Convert the header to use font "Oooh Baby" and add this prompt to
  PROMPTS.md.
- Replace the font "Oooh Baby" with "Playwrite New Zealand Basic" and
  write this prompt to PROMPTS.md.
- Center the name in the center of the page and increase the font size
  by 50%.
- Add standard spacing between the menu links, and to the bottom
  margin.
