# Claude AI Prompts

- Create a starter website in ~/Devel/personal/web/ai/lloydflanagan which uses
  python for the back end and lit with shoelace for the front end. It should
  have a home page with "A Lloyd Flanagan" as a header, and a menu with links
  "About Me", "Blog", "Education", each of which links to an empty page.
- Add a file to the project called PROMPTS.md. Write a markdown list with the
  heading "Claude AI Prompts" and each prompt for this session.
- Modify the PROMPTS.md file to wrap text at column 80, and append this prompt
  to the list.
- Convert the header to use font "Oooh Baby" and add this prompt to
  PROMPTS.md.
- Replace the font "Oooh Baby" with "Playwrite New Zealand Basic" and
  write this prompt to PROMPTS.md.
- Center the name in the center of the page and increase the font size
  by 50%.
- Add standard spacing between the menu links, and to the bottom
  margin.
- Add a paragraph after the Welcome message that says "This is an AI
  experiment &mdash; all code was generated from AI (Claude 4.6)."
- Add a new menu item "Prompts" which links to a new page that
  displays the prompts from PROMPTS.md in an attractive layout.
- Debug and fix the error that menu links don't link to their
  targets.
- Add README.md document which describes the project in detail.
  Include a badge for this AI model.
- Add a link to the GitHub repository in the upper right of the
  header.
- Add a Home link to the menu, and make the name in the header be
  a link to the home page.
- fix error "Could not find FastAPI app in module, try using --app"
- In README.md file, at the end of "generated by Claude 4.6", add a
  footnote: "Except for certain files related to deployment.".
- Add a gitlab workflow to deploy to fly.io when I push to main branch.
- Add alloydflanagan.com to the URL whitelist.
- add lloydflanagan.fly.dev to allowed hosts
- Create a new page at URL design/ with the title "Design Notes". Add a link
  from the home page under the github logo labelled "Design". On the first card
  on the page, write a short paragraph listing the design goals for the site.
  In another card, list each of the major third-party software products used
  with a short description of why they were chosen. Add this prompt to
  PROMPTS.md.
- Add more space between the github logo and the Design link, using a shoelace
  spacing variable. Change the color of the link to use a light shoelace accent
  color.
- For each software name in the second card of the design page, change the name
  into a link to the tool's main web site.
