A personal website for A. Lloyd Flanagan — and an experiment in
AI-generated web development. **Every line of code in this project was
generated by Claude 4.6**[^1], Anthropic's AI assistant, guided entirely
through natural-language prompts.

[^1]: Except for certain files related to deployment.

## About the Project

This site serves as both a personal web presence and a transparent
demonstration of what AI-assisted development looks like in practice.
The full list of prompts used to build the site is available on the
[Prompts page](PROMPTS.md) and is also rendered as a page within the
site itself.

## The AI Experiment

This project explores a workflow where a human provides high-level
direction through natural-language prompts, and an AI writes all the
code. The prompts range from initial scaffolding ("Create a starter
website…") to iterative refinements ("Center the name…", "Debug and
fix…"). The full prompt history is preserved in
[PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) as a record of the development process.
